# Database

##Day 1 (Monday): From business to database - Database design 
We will look at different types of data models and how logical data models are transformed into physical data models. Focus will be on design principles and central properties for database tables. You will learn how to forward engineer a database from visual database modeling in MySQL Workbench.

###Readings/Tutorials: 
https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-data-modeling.html

###Homework:
Create a Library database by forward engineering a MYSQL Workbench EER diagram (see Library-System.pdf for spec).

##Day 2 (Tuesday): SQL Queries 
We will recap the SQL select statement to query a database. We will focus on multi-table queries (joins) and SQL aggregate functions (especially grouping of results) 

###Tutorials: 
There are different resources about SQL and MySQL online. Three good ones are: 

http://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp 

http://www.mysqltutorial.org/basic-mysql-tutorial.aspx

http://www.mysqltutorial.org/

Wikipedia also has good examples for most SQL commands

###Homework:
Finish SQL Select statement exercises in the slides from today (see last slide for more info).

##Day 3 (Wednesday): SQL Data manipulation (DML) and Data Definition (DDL) 
We will work with SQL DML statements SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE and SQL DDL statements CREATE TABLE and CREATE VIEW. We will also briefly cover backup of tables.
 
###Tutorials: 
Same as Day 2

##Day 4 (Thursday): Normalization and optimization
We will work with quality techniques for database design to avoid redundant data that can lead to inconsistencies in the database.
